// He is allowed to select n marbles.
// There are marbles of k different colors. From each color,

// HÃ¤nschen wants to have at least one marble of each color, 
// but still there are a lot of possibilities for his selection.

// he can slelect n marbles and want k different color marble
// so first filled take 1 marble of k type now we can take (n-k) marbles
// take m=n-k marbles from k type 
// star and bars concept WE HAVE TO FIND m stars and k-1 bars
// m+k-1 place k-1 bars so ans = (m+k-1)C(k-1) put m value= (n-1)C(k-1)
